Actually, I am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end to non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they are killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why he is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot fo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of fun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final regular season game.          PENS RULE!!!   \n",

Think!  It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks...  The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices it is attached when it wants to.  An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.  On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.  >  > Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book, > but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93): >  > \"The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board > direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers.\" > I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter.   > So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT > HDD controller doesn't!?!?

Back in high school I worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental psychologists at Bell Labs.  When they were doing visual perception and memory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond refresh rates common.

Yesterday I was able to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC),  BUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).  I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two afternoon games.  Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.    dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca (not suffering from a shortage of hockey here)  \n",
